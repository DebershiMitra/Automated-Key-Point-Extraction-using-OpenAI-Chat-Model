# Automated-Key-Point-Extraction-using-OpenAI-Chat-Model
This Python script facilitates the automated extraction of key points from a given textual context using OpenAI's language model. It imports necessary modules for interacting with the language model and handling environment variables. The core functionality is encapsulated within the extract_key_points_from_response function.

Here's a breakdown:

Importing Modules:

The script imports the ChatOpenAI class from the chat_models module within the langchain package. This class likely facilitates interactions with OpenAI's chat model.
Additionally, it imports the load_dotenv function from the dotenv module for loading environment variables from a .env file.
The built-in os module is imported to access operating system functionalities.
Function Definition: extract_key_points_from_response:

This function takes a single argument query, representing the textual context from which key points need to be extracted.
It initializes a ChatOpenAI instance with an API key obtained from the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.
Constructs a prompt string incorporating the given query.
Calls the predict method of the ChatOpenAI instance with the constructed prompt to receive a response from the language model.
Processes the response:
Strips leading and trailing whitespace.
Splits the response into a list of sentences using newline (\n) as the separator.
Trims whitespace from each sentence and prefixes it with . •• if not empty.
Returns a list containing the top 5 key points extracted from the context.
Environment Variable Usage:

The API key required for accessing the OpenAI service is fetched from the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable. This enhances security by keeping sensitive information out of the codebase.
Error Handling:

The code lacks explicit error handling. Exceptions might occur if the OPENAI_API_KEY is not set or if there are issues with the API call.
This script offers a streamlined approach to extracting key points from textual contexts, leveraging the capabilities of OpenAI's language model. It abstracts away the complexities of interacting with the model, providing a reusable function for automated key point extraction.
